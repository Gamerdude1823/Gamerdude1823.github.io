# BYUI DS Portfolio Template
## Building a Quarto Portfolo

A template for a portfolio developed with Quarto and hosted on GitHub.

This is all configured so you only need to edit the source files in Quarto (.qmd). The website is generated and hosted automatically by GitHub.

## Using this template

1. Click on green button "Use this Tempalte" -> "Create a new Repo"

1. Choose a name for your repository

1. Important: check 'Include all branches' when creating the repository (because we will need the gh-pages branch to host the website).

1. Once your repo is created, remember to update the links to your GitHub repo in _quarto.yml, replacing every instance 'your_name'.

1. The first time you publish to your repo use this command line string `quarto publish gh-pages` in the vs code terminal.
